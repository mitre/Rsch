A package to connect to remote systems, execute system commands, collect results from `stdout`.

## Use

`Rsch` enables users to connect to remote systems and issue commnads, similar to what the base `system` function enables for the local system.
This can be used to interrogate remote file systems, read data (e.g., using a `cat` or `head` system command), or execute any other system command that you like.

## Key Features

New connections are created using `get_connection`.
Given a connection, `execute` will run a command on the remote system.
The `execute` function will not return anything to your local R session.
To get a return value, `printout` will capture everything printed to the remote `stdout` since the last call to `execute`.
When you are done manipulating the remote system, use `goodbye` to close the connection.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}       
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mitre/Rsch", subdir = "rpkg")
```
